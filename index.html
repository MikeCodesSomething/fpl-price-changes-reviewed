    <h1>FPL Price Predictors Reviewed</h1>
    <div class="container">
    <div class="intro">
        <p>As FPL managers, we're often torn between moving early to beat the price changes and waiting until the last possible minute to transfer so we can get as much team news as possible. Naturally this means we want to know <strong>when</strong> a price change will occur. There are 3 websites out there that predict which prices will change overnight, but are their predictions accurate? and which one is the <strong>most</strong> accurate?</p> 
               

    </div>
    <div class="intro"> 
        
        <p>The following table measures how accurate each price predictor site has been so far this season, based on simple objective daily measures.</p>
        <p><strong>How many of their rise/fall predictions were correct</strong></p>
        <p><strong>How many price rises/falls did they miss?</strong></p>
        <p>This table gets updated every day, see how the data is collected at the bottom of the page.</p>

        <caption>Price Change Predictor Accuracy</caption>
    </table>
    <div class="narrative">
        <p>My main takeaway here is not to treat players as 'safe' even if they're not predicted to rise/fall tonight, none of the price change predictors are as accurate as we'd like on a daily basis, especially for price falls. <strong>fplstatistics</strong> is best overall, but here's my brief review of each:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong><a href="https://fplstatistics.co.uk">fplstatistics:</a></strong> good for price rises, head and shoulders above the others for price falls, but still misses a lot of fallers.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="https://www.fantasyfootballhub.co.uk/fantasy-premier-league-price-rises">fantasyfootballhub:</a></strong> good for price rises, poor for price falls - massively UNDERestimates how many players will fall - partly due to excluding players with less than 0.7% ownership</li>
        <li><strong><a href="https://www.fantasyfootballfix.com/price/">fantasyfootballfix:</a></strong> not as good as the others for price rises, poor for price falls - massively OVERestimates how many players will fall.</li>
    </ul>
        <h2>Methodology:</h2>
        <p>They do it in different ways, but ultimately the bit of information I'm looking for from each site is 'Which players do you predict are rising/falling tonight', therefore I manually recorded the players predicted to rise on each site every night between 10:00 - 10:30 PM UK time* and then compared them to the results the next morning. Here's how I collected the data for each site:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong><a href="https://www.fantasyfootballfix.com/price/">fantasyfootballfix:</a></strong> I recorded every player with a 'change time' of 'tonight.'</li>
            <li><strong><a href="https://fplstatistics.co.uk">fplstatistics:</a>
            </strong> I tracked every player highlighted with a blue/red target (this is basically the same as the target being +/- 100%, but should be slightly more accurate due to rounding).</li>
            <li><strong><a href="https://www.fantasyfootballhub.co.uk/fantasy-premier-league-price-rises">fantasyfootballhub</a>
            </strong> I included every player with a 'change time' of 'tonight.. (extra disclaimer - there is 5 days of missing data for ffhub, some days it was down when I wanted to get the data and some days I missed ffhub out)</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>*this time was as close to the ~1am price change time as I could be bothered to do, and it seemed like a realistic time managers would be checking it. You could reasonably expect higher accuracy if I took these at 00:59.</p>
    
        <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I collected this data manually, and there may be mistakes in both my data collection and formulas. While I've taken great care to ensure accuracy, pobody's nerfect. Please consider this when interpreting the stats.</p>
